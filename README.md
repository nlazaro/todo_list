# todo_list
A todo list that uses a progress bar for due dates



TO DO LIST:
- progress bar for due dates
- smart todo list; if I type "due 4/24" the app should automatically make the task due on 4/24 and remove that text
- friends list / badges
- "my day" list that resets evert 24hrs
- color codes for tasks, red for important, yellow for semi important, blue for not as important, etc.
- web browser / program on pc --> android app 

- OH OKAY
